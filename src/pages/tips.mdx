If you have something you’d like to share anonymously, fill in the form below. We always protect the identity of our sources.

**DISCLAIMER:** Submissions are anonymous to us. They are handled by Google Forms.
If you are concerned about traceability, or you feel your submission could put you at risk:

- Do not use a university email,
- Consider using a personal device and network.

For spam-prevention reasons, Google Forms does not allow anonymous file uploads. If you wish to submit files, please include a link to them in your response (for example, via a file-sharing service), and ensure we have permission to access them at investigations@cheesegratermagazine.org.

Please be aware that third-party file-sharing services may collect their own metadata, and you are responsible for choosing how and where to host any files you share.
