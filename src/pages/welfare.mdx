This page provides information about support services available to students at UCL and an anonymous submission form for any welfare concerns you may have at The Cheese Grater Magazine Society.

### Student Support & Wellbeing Services

The SSW team of expert wellbeing, disability, and mental health staff provide a safe, confidential, and non-judgemental space, in which you can discuss any issues that may be affecting your ability to study. All of their support services are free of charge and open to UCL students of all levels.

### Students' Union Advice Service

The Union Advice Service is a team of experienced caseworkers ready to support you with any difficulties that might occur during your time at UCL, specialising in academic issues, housing, employment, and money advice. Sessions are confidential and will not be reported to your department or any other university staff unless at your request. Students can make an appointment or attend a drop-in session for free, confidential, and independent advice and support.
