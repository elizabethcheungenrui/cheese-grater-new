### Pitches

If you have an idea for the publication we would love to hear from you! As a membership publication, we can only accept pitches for news and satire stories from members of the Society. You can get your year-long membership [here](https://studentsunionucl.org/clubs-societies/cheese-grater-magazine) for the low, low price of just £8.

The good news is that you do not need a membership to pitch opinion pieces for [Voices & Letters](/voices), a forum of lively debate open to all UCL students, staff, and alumni! Voices pitches must still relate to the student experience at UCL and express a genuinely held view. Letters to the Editors work in the same way, except they should be no longer than 150 words and should contain your name and address — we will only publish your first name and your London borough. Send your views to editor@cheesegratermagazine.org or, even better, come along to one our weekly meetings (details are always on our Instagram). We’re a friendly bunch, promise!
